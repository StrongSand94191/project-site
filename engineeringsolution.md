# Engineering Solution

Our engineering solution is a battery for civilians. It ensures equal access to energy by ensuring that individuals can still access energy for a limited amount of time in the event of blackouts. These blackouts usually last for 12-14 hours. It can be installed in a home to store excess energy and output 16 hours worth of energy to power an upper-class home. This amounts to 295 kWh. Assuming advancements in energy technology go well, the price of a battery per kWh, which is currently $36, could go as low as $3.

This would mean that this battery, which would cost $10,200 with todayâ€™s technology, could cost as little as $880.
