# Social Solution

Our social solution is to make better use of nuclear energy. Southeast Asia's energy demands are rapidly growing as its countries advance their technologies, and infrastructure is needed to fill that gap. The best long-term solution would be to use nuclear energy, which is safer, more efficient, and more consistent than other forms of green energy. However, its initial cost is extremely high, so the constituents of the ASEAN may not be able to afford it. So for this solution, we will need to contact allied countries such as China for financial help.
