# Problem Statement
> "Access to energy is essential for daily life, economic development, and societal stability. However, floods often disrupt traditional energy infrastructure or impact the availability of energy. These interruptions can have severe impacts on health, safety, and economic activity. Globally, engineers face the challenge of creating energy systems using available and emerging technologies that are feasible, reproducible in scale, and resilient to such disruptions, ensuring consistent and sustainable access to energy even in the face of unpredictable and challenging situations as flooding." 

## Design Statement
> We, as engineers, will design, test, and build solutions to protect energy infrastructure against flooding in Southeast Asia and create solutions to upgrade the existing infrastructure in realistic, ethical, and resilient ways because Southeast Asia is commonly affected by floods that can damage the vital energy infrastructure that many need to go about their lives. These solutions must be green, sustainable, cost-effective, and realistically viable.
